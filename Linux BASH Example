While using Linux OS Ubuntu; I created a script for automation using BASH to review certain portions of the Linux system in this use case.
Below is an example of the BASH script created:

#!/bin/bash
	

	#Creates directory named RESEARCH
	cd /home/sysadmin/
	mkdir research
	

	#Lists auth.log and/or checks to see if it exists
	ls /var/log/auth.log
	

	#Command is issued to see if Desktop and Downloads directories exists.
	ls /home/sysadmin/
	

	#Lists the cat and ps binary files.
	ls /bin/cat
	ls /bin/ps
	

	#Checked to see if any scripts in temporary directory exists.
	ls /tmp.
	

	#Check that the only certain users are listed in the /home directory 
	ls /home.
